## What I learned from this tutorial

- I liked following his thought process about how and why he gave elements specific class names and ids. Styling and calling elements in javascript is way easier if the naming of page contents makes logical sense.
- He built the page from the top down
- I liked the way he chose to manipulate the DOM through removing elements in specific functions and then re-added them as content changes in another function.
- He made use of querySelector and querySelectorAll, which I was recently trying to use in another project.
- I liked how he layed out his CSS with more globally-based styles at the top and utility-based stuff at the bottom.
- I tried to reference it as little as possible, but I'm glad he included access to the source files on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/bradtraversy/pen/yWPONg). I had one or two hang-ups and weeding through his code helped to spot the discrepancies. It also helped to grab his images.
